WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And then start recording. Then should I just ask you the questions. Yes. Okay, good.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
recording.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Okay, good, good life.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Hi.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is an interview to study the how, collaboration, remote collaboration affects remote meetings.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So I'll start off with a list of around 14 questions and you'll have to answer them a little subjectively, so that we are rich on data.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Okay, so the first one. So tell us a bit about the last meeting, you had with a collaborator from your team.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Okay, so I lost my mighty such a major event, I'd say.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Wednesday. Wednesday.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And then, like what kind of things do you want to know, like I met her on Wednesday for about two hours.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And then we worked on coding of data. Yeah, so what was like the main purpose of the meeting, and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the main purpose would be to qualitatively code, some discussions from mailing lists of Apache projects, big projects. Okay.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Good.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Okay, so did this meeting go as planned.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Yeah, I did the objectives of the meeting met.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Yeah, we were trying to get as much of coding as possible because it takes quite a lot of time. So we did not do a full two hours because he got super tired by the end of like one or 30 minutes.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Okay, and then we stopped. Select and do as much as we thought we could.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Okay, so do you think the stopping in between broke your flow of thought or whatever the flows.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Not really smell.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Oh, when we as coding data, it does take a lot of, like we have to continuously think so.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
When we do take a break.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Stop this noise.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It's finally.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Yeah.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Okay.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Yeah, so whenever we do like take a break, it's more like a refresher, so they can come back and start again. It's not exactly the kind of like the way you would do it in a physical environment.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Yeah, just go take a walk and come back and come back.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Okay.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So according to you work the objectives of the meeting satisfied.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Oh, yeah, I would say so.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Do you have your objectives planned before the meeting.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:19.000
In order for the collaboration to go more smoothly, or do you guys kind of build upon ideas as you go into the meeting. No, we always have a fixed agenda of what we are doing.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And since it's sort of my project that she's working on. So I have to decide on the agenda items based on how much of work I need to be done with by the end of the week.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
OK, cool.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So the next question is, what communication channels do you most frequently use

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
email and messaging video, audio.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So these are kind of the most frequently used ones.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Yeah, so we do not use emails we do Slack, or

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:12.000
slack or zoom. Is there a reason why you choose Slack, or like slack specifically if just like my research group is a slack. So pretty.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Yeah. Okay, so they're pretty active there. So that's what we got used to.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Okay, so just because that's the most available thing. And do you guys find yourself using teams.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Microsoft Teams No, no, we always use zoom. And like we have our zoom rooms pinned in the Slack channel. Okay.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And then whenever we want to just hop on a meeting with his take on that like we do not on this keep going back and changing slack kind of being live like if you go to the, go into the details of how slack functions.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:09.000
There are some things which are like kind of a little tricky to figure out like replying the specific comments, or probably there or something because I had myself experience, kind of those things.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So, do you think those are kind of those kind of block your flow.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Everything remotely.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I've been using Skype for over a year now so in the beginning, I did have issues like I didn't know what a slack bot was and I'm looking at slack right now.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And then, I didn't know how to, like, I don't know what I still don't know what add apps do like what am I adding, etc.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:50.000
But, um, yeah like right now I don't see a point because it's, it's just like messaging for me just on my computer messaging.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Okay, moving on to the next question. What tools, did you use during this meeting, what do you prefer I think you answered this one unknown so in this meeting I used access di.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Okay, one second. Tools meaning. Okay, good. Atlas, the atlas.tv and put it under.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Stop.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Okay.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Is this a software you guys commonly use yeah this is a software that we use for qualitative coding. Okay, cool.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Okay, so how much time did you spend on collaborating collaborative meetings last week. And can you walk me through one of those meetings, what did you discuss how many people were involved.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
How many projects were discuss what communication channels you used.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Okay, at this point, I forgot the first question.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:04.000
So, remind me of a time when you collaboratively met with people to like basically a scenario where you actually met with somebody. And what did you do, what did you guys discuss.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Okay.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And over the, over the week. you are asking me how many meetings I did.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Is that was that a question I was asking you about like one scenario where you met and, like, maybe you could tell me the last scenario you met with your collaborators.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And this was something I met with them.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Today morning. Okay.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Today morning. I met with them at 10am, and then we were basically doing a code said validation.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So like the accuracy of stuff that we're working on.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So, we make a court set out of that. And then we need to work with experts to sort of validate, whatever we're doing is correct or not.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Okay. And how many people were involved in this meeting. So, in this it was for people.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Okay, it was for people.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Do you think, have you met with collaborators, more than like 10 or something at a time.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Well then, I would think so. So my, my Monday.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:41.000
By Monday 11am meetings and my Friday 1pm meeting about a 14 people will notice any differences between having like only for collaborators over a meeting, and having more than 10 collaborators over a meeting our those kind of different in your case.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So whenever it is 10 people or more than 10 people we tend to see something like we go around the table, and then everybody gives their updates, stand up and then daily stand up anything.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:14.000
No, it's not a daily stand up thing it's like you could say a weekly stand up thing but then we all work on different projects, which has. Let's say, for a ti for example in this class, says with every project guru had to given give a summary of what

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
they did this week. Okay.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Something like that.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:29.000
It's informal, but we first do that. And then we each go to a breakout rooms. If anybody needs to talk to anybody else. Okay.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Yeah, and that's how we do this. So it's basically a level overview. Yeah, high level overview view and then it sort of anyway comes down to three or four people meetings.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Okay, and those three or four people meetings are kind of more intimate.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Oh, yes and no. So I don't know what you mean by intimate.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Meaning, use Be alert you are able to collaborate more effectively. In those four or five member group meetings.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Yes, definitely. So now, with 10 people it's a lot more chaotic and then it sort of also decrease people's time because like always 10 people are not chiming in into one thing unless it's like an IRB thing, and then everybody wants has to do something

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
about it.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I would say I would say the four or five people meeting is better, like, two is even better, because then you get all your answer questions answered. Okay.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Okay, so basically what I'm observing as a trend line, you would say is like less than number of people.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
The more physical close to physical communication and becomes.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Yes.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Yeah, but I wouldn't say it's better communication because that depends on maybe exaggerate the number and kind of extrapolate it to like 50 guys.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
It won't be as effective maybe like.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:16.000
It won't be as effective. Yeah. Okay, so Okay, the next question.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
If people are not having the videos on.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Does that bother you, or do you see anyone being bothered by that.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:40.000
I don't do it, but I am definitely distracted where I don't have my video on, like I just I just keep checking my phone, and like indoors passes or even during meetings.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I do get distracted if I do not have my video on and I know that nobody's watching me.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Okay, so, do you think that might be affecting affecting the productivity of the group as a whole.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Okay.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Okay, cool.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Next question on Did you feel that having video on all the time is necessary, or, like, the entire entirety of the meeting, or you can have periods of times where you have your video of.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I also like in the early in the morning I don't own any way to see my morning phase.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And then I will not have my video on deck I'm more comfortable recording my video on, because then in the morning and I don't have too many things to think of like if you have to participate in the meeting and also, you know.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Yeah, Alex Do you can they make sure you're looking okay and like, okay, no good. So, that is one point where I'm comfortable with the video off ok ok so the next question.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:54.000
How did you feel about individual contributions. During the meetings you've had before.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:03.000
With your collaborators, like, On the basis of everybody's individual contribution.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Are they equal. The skewed are.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:32.000
So, in my meetings. I feel like we have all kinds of collaborative like there is, there would be some professors, like let's say no meeting or five people that will be two professors to PhD students and one undergraduate student.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
So, the contributions are definitely buried.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000
So, the undergraduate student, we sort of give them.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Like easier.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Things to do like the metal fingers on a paper like I'm just talking about a paper submission thing that we were doing recently. So like the undergraduate students she was responsible for fixing figures.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I, me and other people to read we were responsible for writing down things. So like we were writing paragraphs and then our advisors, they were discussing what the story of the people should be like an F like give me should be writing this story or that

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:34.000
story. So it's three levels of different things.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Okay.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
So okay.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Okay.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:57.000
The next question. What do you think about team members being able to express themselves and speak up about their opinions. During the meeting, like, and does everybody get a fair chance, do you think that some people are left out.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:12.000
I've seen people who are like, shy, would not like want to speak up as not probably use the chat feature on zoom, would they probably use the chat feature on zoom.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Okay, so okay so this remote collaboration thing kind of has the shy people being more shy, kind of thing, like as compared to some physical communication.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I see so i think i think it sort of has an effect when you like.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Like, people are talking here in a zoom meeting and, like for example in this meeting, I don't see that his picture here like a video is not on. So, if she does want to see something.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:16:00.000
So, we will not be able to understand and she will have to make that whole effort herself, without making any gestures. Okay, so I would say not being able to make gestures with, like, because of the video being on would be okay.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Difficult like. It happens quite a lot of times if I advisors when I'm like when they are speaking and I have a question. And I would like something I do some, some weird gesture so that like somebody catches me up on it and they're like okay, go on,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
say like don't, it's okay to interrupt.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:29.000
You know, so do you feel that, just as a follow up to this day feel that less of body language is captured. While remote collaborating.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And that has an effect on how you might interpret or perceive the other person.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:53.000
I think it would be different. Definitely but for me it has been very.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Okay, I don't I don't get to perceive anything it's like almost feels like talking to a robot. Okay.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
The next question.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Did you and your team, join your last meeting on time. If not, why not. And does it happen often.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:32.000
So how are you guys on in collaborating in terms of punctuality being on time stuff, most of us are usually on time, except for like one or two people who are like too busy or people who are like still in another meeting and then they have to come and

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Russian come. Okay. And do you guys find yourself.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Like, while you guys are waiting, do you guys find yourself just kept you yourself on mute. Not talking.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:58.000
And, or do you guys have discussions, irrespective of the busier people not being there.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:11.000
In most of my meetings, I would say we still keep talking. If there are enough people. But in certain cases like for example we have three people for like a group meeting.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:22.000
And then one of the courses to take it's a vital to know her opinion on our stuff. So we just say that, oh let's just wait for her to join, and then we'll meet them uteruses and like to stay there.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Okay.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Good. that's interesting.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:44.000
The next question. Okay, so do you think remotely collaborating affects the task efficiency of individual members.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.000
We have you seen people underperform or over perform.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:05.000
For example, as you mentioned in your earlier question that if your videos of, you feel that you are distracted and you might not perform as much.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Yeah, so definitely taken students for classes for meetings I can see that.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Yeah, for meetings.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:30.000
I can see that. Sometimes you know people. So now, people do not really have to be like you know officials in an official setting for a meeting. They can be anywhere and like, I don't know, like, just anywhere even be hanging out with their friends and

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:42.000
then be on a meeting right. So, in that case, for sure I feel it affects efficiency because we're not there. Yeah.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:55.000
And then, if, if the work is based on how much of concentration, you need to have. Then I feel it really does affect all quite a lot.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:04.000
And does this do you find this affecting the levels of trust you have amongst a group members who are collaborating remotely.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
I tell you.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Okay.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Just to extrapolate on this. How,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:24.000
how welcoming, are you have a stranger joining a collaborative meeting, like,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:43.000
as we're, like, as properly as you would in a physical communication environment. So, stranger collaborating, like a stranger joining the meeting as a collaborator or like for example you have like a new member joining your team and your professor tells

00:20:43.000 --> 00:21:00.000
you that she's a part of your research thing going on. Okay, I think, I think it's more interactive than when a new person has joined because like, it's like, it breaks the monotony of it.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:09.000
meeting recently, like join our group recently and she has bags, as decorations on her wall. So she has so many bags.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Like, it looks like decor.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
So, you know, it's fun. Good.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Okay, the last question.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Last question is, do you have anything specific or any specific incident, you encounter during remote collaboration which you would like to share with me, have anything really specific, you would like to mention

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
to the process of giving answers to this interview.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Yeah, I can see that

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:52.000
the challenges that we face right so quite a couple of times. Zoom screen sharing.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:02.000
And then like whatever is we're doing a for example zoom even recording, sometimes doesn't really work out as we think it would.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:12.000
And like these calls like random challenges that we will not like, okay. So, for example, once I recorded a meeting and then it was supposed to be recording my audio.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:25.000
But then, since I had been your phone on it was using the microphone and it was capturing the sound my room and not what I was listening to. So basically I recorded a video but I did not get anything out of it.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:37.000
So, technical difficulties kind of thing. Yeah. And do you feel these technical difficulties quite often like, for example, people not being on mute.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Or maybe you don't want something you please press the wrong button, which caused you to do something, which was an unintentional or something.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Yeah, quite a lot of times. So with that, when I'm sharing screen and I'm also like doing like using Google Docs and Google Sheet.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:17.000
And then it just freezes don't go with your faces and then I'm just stuck somewhere.
